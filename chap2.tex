\chapter{The Loop Gap Resonator}

As mentioned in the introduction, for many applied modalities within applications that use NV centers, the MW field (often denoted $B_1$ from NMR nomenclature), requires both high power and high uniformity to achieve high-fidelity quantum-state manipulation over the entire sample volume. As volumes are increased however, to maximize the number of NVs addressed without having a deleterious affect on the optimal measurement time, applying such a field becomes more difficult using standard approaches such as shorted coaxial loops \cite{clevenson2015broadband,chipaux2015magnetic}, microstrip waveguides \cite{andrich2017long,horowitz2012electron}, and 50 $\Omega$-terminated coaxial transmission lines \cite{li2010design,mrozek2015circularly,zhang2016microwave,zhang2018vector}. These broadband approaches allow arbitrary drive frequencies, however, the lack of resonant enhancement forces a compromise between the addressed volume and field strength. Section \ref{Planar} describes how planar lumped-element resonators such as split-ring resonators \cite{bayat2014efficient}, planar-ring resonators \cite{zhang2016microwave,sasaki2016broadband}, omega resonators \cite{twig2013ultra,horsley2018microwave,simpson2017electron}, and patch antennas \cite{zhang2016microwave} can improve coupling between the resonator and the NVs by resonantly enhancing the local $B_1$ field and thus enable MW driving over larger regions, but at the expense of bandwidth and thus, for an operational magnetometer, dynamic range. Additionally, planar resonators are shown to yield poor homogeneity in the planes normal to their surface and therefore lend themselves less to bulk magnetometry than to 2D imaging applications. To address this shortcoming 3D resonators and cavities can be employed such as enclosed metallic cavity resonators \cite{rose2017coherent}, enclosed dielectric resonators \cite{breeze2017continuous,floch2016towards,creedon2015strong}, open dielectric resonators \cite{kapitanova2017dielectric}, and three-dimensional lumped element resonators \cite{angerer2016collective}, which provide good field homogeneity and strong resonantly enhanced fields, but offer little to no optical access. Since all-optical initialization and readout is a primary benefit for many solid-state spin systems, including NV diamond \cite{doherty2013nitrogen}, such a trade-off is incompatible with many existing and envisioned applications \cite{schirhagl2014nitrogen}. 

To address this current shortcoming a three-dimensional tunable loop-gap resonator (LGR), based on the anode block of a cavity magnetron, is used to achieve desired MW drive strengths homogeneously over large areas. Additionally, its open geometry allows for good optical accessibility for interrogation volumes centered within the LGR cavity. Traditionally, the LGR has been used either as the anode block of cavity magnetrons \cite{}, or as a low frequency (2-4 GHz) lumped element resonator for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies \cite{}.

\section{LGR Design}

Due to the loop gap resonator's existence since the early 20th century \cite{collins1948microwave} it has seen many variations and modifications all designed with particular applications in mind. Figure \ref{} shows the cross section of a variety of LGRs including rising-sun, vane, slot, and hole-and-slot type resonators. EPR experiments at low frequencies (2-4 GHz) quickly adopted the LGR as opposed to more traditional TE\textsubscript{102} type cavities because of the LGRs smaller size relative to the frequency of excitation. At 3 GHz the side length of the TE\textsubscript{102} cavity must be at least 5 cm which reduces drastically the cavity filling factor--a parameter necessary for the sensitivity of an EPR signal. Since many aspects of EPR spectroscopy are mirrored in NV magnetometry (requirement of homogeneous and strong microwave signals, frequency of operation, etc.) we selected to design a hole-and-slot type resonator found in many EPR applications \cite{}.

\subsection{LGR}

A standard hole-and-slot LGR with $n$ outer loops can be approximated as $n$ coupled LC resonators oscillating in tandem at a target resonant frequency \cite{wood1984loop}. Circulating currents around the central and outer loops create a total inductance, as found in section \ref{circuit}, 

% When circuit model section is written take out these equations and simply reference them.

\begin{equation}
L \approx \frac{L_c n L_o}{n L_o + L_c},
\end{equation}\label{induct}

and charge at the gap walls create a total capacitance C, which is given by

\begin{equation}
C \approx \frac{\epsilon_r \epsilon_o A}{nd},
\end{equation} \label{cap}

which, when combined yield the resonant frequency

\begin{equation}
f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[t!]

\end{figure}

In practice, the central loop diameter is set to $\sim 5-10 $ mm, corresponding to the typical size of a diamond plate. The outer loop diameters are chosen to match the inner diameters within a small factor to ensure return flux is captured and does not extend into the annular region around the LGR \cite{}. Since the outer and inner loops set the effective inductance of the resonator, the gap area $A$ is constrained by the dual LGR design objectives of (i) maintaining optical accessibility, which limits the thickness of the device, and (ii) bounding $f_0$ above the target resonant frequency in order to allow for further tuning vie dielectric shims (discussed in section \ref{tuning}). Additionally, while increasing the number $n$ of loops and gaps can improve $B_1$ uniformity \cite{piasecki1993field} and lower the LGR's resonant frequency, this approach results in a denser mode spectrum \cite{froncisz1982loop} and increases the likelihood of cross-mode excitations deleteriously altering the field distribution within the central loop. As a compromise, the design employs $n=4$ outer loops [Fig. \ref{LGR_drawing} (a)] allowing for sufficient uniformity while locating the closest eigenmode more than 1.5 GHz below the TE\textsubscript{10} eigenmode [Fig \ref{}].  

The LGR in this work therefore consists of a central loop with radius $r_c = 4$ mm surrounded by four symmetrically arranged outer loops of radius $r_o = 3$ mm as shown in Figure \ref{LGR_drawing} (b). The outer loops return magnetic flux to the central loop and therefore oscillate antisymmetrically with the central loop ($\pi$ out of phase). The side walls of the capacitive gaps are separated by $d = 254$ $\upmu$m. With these dimensions, using equations \ref{induct} and \ref{cap}, $L = 8.7$ nH and $C = 0.17$ pF, resulting in an expected resonant frequency for the naked air-gapped LGR of $f_0 = 4.1$ GHz, approximately 1.2 GHz above the NV resonance frequencies.

An eigenfrequency simulation of the resonator using the geometrical parameters listed above was completed in ANSYS HFSS and the distribution of the magnetic flux density ($B_1$) for the TE\textsubscript{10} mode is depicted in Figure \ref{LGR_Eigen}.
