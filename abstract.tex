In this thesis, the loop gap resonator (LGR) is presented as a mechanism for the delivery of resonantly enhanced and uniform microwave fields to large volume samples of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Specifically, an S-band tunable LGR and its constituent excitation circuitry are designed that allow directionally uniform, strong, homogeneous, and broadband
microwave (MW) driving of an NV ensemble over an area larger than 32 mm\textsuperscript{2}. Two methods of coupling to the resonator are implemented and discussed. The LGR design, based on the anode
block of a cavity magnetron, demonstrates an average field amplitude of 5 gauss at 42 dBm of input power, and achieves a peak-to-peak
field uniformity of 89.5\% over an area of 32.2 mm\textsuperscript{2} and 97\% over an area of 11 mm\textsuperscript{2}. The broad bandwidth of the LGR is capable of addressing all resonances of an NV ensemble for bias magnetic Fields up to 14 gauss. Furthermore, with cavity
ring-down-times in the single nanoseconds, the resonator is compatible with the pulsed MW techniques necessary for a wide range of NV-diamond
applications.
